Follow the Back to Blue podcast for more insights. Hello and welcome to The Intelligence from The Economist. I'm your host, Aura Ogunbiyi. Every weekday we provide a fresh perspective on the events shaping your world. There's a wave of Americans seeking greener pastures in Europe. The increase in remote working opportunities is encouraging people to take the plunge. But as our correspondent discovers, for many, the main driving factors run deeper. And, Ukrainian fighter pilot Andrei Pilsikov lobbied politicians in Washington and Europe to give his country access to American-made F-16 jets. We pay tribute to the young pilot who was killed during a training flight. First up though. This summer, racial tensions have been rising in the North African nation of Tunisia. Police keeping local Tunisians separated from migrants. Officers covering the entrance to the house where a group of sub-Saharan Africans are living. Tunisians take part in the funeral of a man stabbed to death during a scuffle between residents and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and Tunisia's coastal city of Sfax. The country's population is estimated to be 98% Arab. But recently, more black Africans have started passing through, many of them hoping to cross the Mediterranean and reach Europe. Here in the province of Sfax, on the Gulf of Gabes, a large number of migrants and refugees are waiting for the opportunity to take to the sea. In February, Tunisia's president, Qais Saeed, made a shocking claim that black Africans were part of a plot to change the nation's demography. We are not safe! We are not safe! We are not safe! We are not safe! We are not safe! Despite this being false, his words have had cascading effects ever since, sparking protests and fuelling anti-migrant violence in the streets. They can also be seen as part of a troubling global phenomenon in which fear is weaponised to control a population. Tunisia is interesting at the moment because it's the perfect encapsulation of a dire trend. Robert Guest is the Economist's deputy editor. The president's doing an awful job of running the country and he's tried to distract everybody's attention from that by blaming all the country's problems on black people. Tell me a bit more about what you saw in the city that's at the centre of all this. So I went to Tunisia and I was pretty shocked by what I saw in the city of Sfax. Essentially all the black people in the city had been driven out of their homes by mobs who were telling landlords, we're going to burn down your houses if you don't evict your black tenants. One of the migrants I spoke to there was a guy called Mohammed from Guinea. He had been driven from his home by thugs with petrol bombs and knives. And he showed me his injuries from having been beaten up. He was in a pretty bad way and very desperate to get out of the country. And they were sleeping rough in the middle of the city, hundreds of them sort of huddled together for safety and worried about what was going to happen next. Robert, how did this situation get so dire? Tunisia used to be very hopeful during the Arab Spring. It was pretty much the only Arab country where they overthrew a dictatorship and established a proper democracy. But the current president, who's only been there for a relatively short time, has rapidly set about dismantling the checks and balances of democracy and setting himself up as another dictator. And he wanted to change the conversation. So whereas previously everyone was talking about how bad unemployment was and how bad inflation was, in February he made this speech where he said, you know, the blacks are coming to get you. They seem to have swallowed a huge amount of what the president had said. So whereas, for example, most economists think that the reason Tunisia has a terrible inflation problem is largely down to the bullish policies of the president. I met a guy in Sfax called Mustafa, who said the inflation was caused by black people because they were eating up all the bread and that was why there wasn't any left. You kind of tear your hair out listening to stuff like this. It's extraordinary. Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring. And like you mentioned, it's one of the only revolutions that actually gave rise to a proper democracy. Are you saying that this democratic progress is being reversed, that their democracy is under threat? Absolutely. The president was trying to roll back democracy before he made this speech. And the speech was a way of taking people's minds off the fact that this is what he's doing. So it's given him cover to muzzle the press, purge the judiciary, shut down the national anti-corruption watchdog. And this has had predictable results. The country is more fearful. It's less free. It's also more corrupt, according to Transparency International. So there's been a wholesale reversal of democratic reforms in Tunisia. And this is the oldest trick in the book. And unfortunately, it's becoming more common. The economists did some number crunching recently. And we discovered that not only has paranoid nationalism, the sort of blaming of other groups or your country's problems, not only has that become more common over the past decade or so, but the more nationalist regimes are, the more corrupt they're likely to be and the more likely they are to abuse power. OK. And how has this been played out in other countries? We're seeing this all over the world. You know, nationalism, it can be a force for good, you know, if people will pull together in the face of an external threat. And if that threat is real, as it is for the Ukrainians, for example, then they will team up together to fight off the invader and they will tend to rally round their leader who says he's going to help them defend themselves against the external enemy. The problem is that a lot of leaders have discovered they can get the same rally round the flag effect by completely making up threats. So Vladimir Putin claims that Russia was threatened by Ukrainian Nazis backed by the West. It wasn't true, but it furnished him with an excuse to launch a war of territorial acquisition and it actually made him more popular at home. You see this with all kinds of enemies. So for Nicaragua, for the dictator there, the enemy is the United States. And so he calls all his democratic opponents agents of Uncle Sam. Or in many countries, any social change that makes people feel uncomfortable, the leaders will say this is a foreign idea or a vicious plot by foreigners to undermine our national culture. If the technique didn't work, people wouldn't use it, but it does and they do. And a lot of them are copying each other. And is this just something we see with autocrats? No, absolutely not. This is something that you have to worry about in every kind of country. Whenever you hear a politician say there's a terrible threat coming and I'm going to protect you from it. Like say in Britain, if the leaders of the campaign for Brexit tell you that if we remain in the European Union, then 90 million Turks are going to come to Britain. It's a completely made up threat, but it worked. You know, we're now out of the European Union and a group of not entirely reputable people ended up running the country for some considerable period of time. And I suspect we're going to see it in the American election coming up next year. And Robert, why is fear such a powerful tool? Well, it's a primal emotion. Fear is a survival mechanism. So it's a very attention grabbing rhetorical device. If I say, you know, vote for me and I will make incremental improvements to the school system over the next five to 10 years, that's actually a pretty good platform for governing. But it's a really boring slogan. Whereas if I say the tribe next door are attacking us, vote for me and I will defend you, that's an electrifying slogan. We're an imaginative communicative species. So we're very good at imagining dangers which don't actually exist. And throughout history, you've seen people getting very exercised about dangers which are entirely imaginary, like massive persecution of witches, which do not exist at all. And the modern manifestation of that is very often fear of the other, fear of groups of people who you can't quite see, but who are coming to do you harm in some way. Okay, and so if Mr. Saeed is, as you say, employing these same tools used by unscrupulous leaders, then what might we expect to come next? Is there any hope of a turnaround for Tunisia? In the short run, the Tunisian president's position looks much more solid now than it did before he started whipping up hatred against black Africans. His popularity appears to have vaulted. I mean, the polls aren't terribly reliable, but he seems to have more or less doubled his popularity. Whether he can keep that going indefinitely remains to be seen. But the fear is that if the economy keeps getting worse, which it will, then he may have to raise the temperature even more. And I shudder to think what that might look like.

Ever since Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016, more Americans have been saying they want to leave the country. Matt Steinglass is the Economist Europe correspondent. Gallup, a polling agency, says the percentage who say they would like to leave America permanently rose from 11% under Barack Obama to 16% under Trump. It's now 17%. Not very many people actually did anything about it. But the number of Americans living in Europe has gone up over the past decade. The exact figures are hard to pin down, but they've risen by perhaps 100,000 or so. That's not a lot of emigration for a country of 330 million people, but it is a distinct trend. Two of the people who did something about it are Sylvia and Stanley Johnson. So you've arrived at a really long time. I think it's going up into the 80s today. Oh yeah? Yeah. They went to interview them at their bustling house in Lisbon, Portugal, where they live with their four kids. This is Samaya. She just graduated today. Hi. Congratulations. Samaya, this is Matt. Back in 2020, the Johnsons were living well. They both had their own practices, Sylvia as a psychiatrist, Stanley as a personal injuries lawyer. And they were living as a family in a great big house in Orlando, Florida. A six-bedroom, six and a half bath, about $6,000 square foot home that sat on a lake and I mean, you know, quote unquote, the American dream. But the white fence. And then in 2020, they gave it up. They moved to New Zealand and then to Lisbon. Sylvia says they left the U.S. for a lot of reasons, but the biggest two were gun violence and racism, two things that were very much present in both of their lives. I've had a gun pulled on me three times in my life. On my side of the family, I've had two first cousins die by gun violence and the likelihood of these things happening, it's higher in the African-American community because of the intense racism. And so I was determined to find a place where we could raise our children, where they would not be subjected to that treatment. Sylvia had wanted to try taking the family abroad for a long time, but Stanley said no. I never had any interest of leaving the United States. She would always like, kind of like bring it up. And I'm like, well, that's home. And it just wasn't desirable to me. So what changed? Partly Sylvia and Stanley say it was the COVID pandemic. Everyone was working from home and Sylvia convinced Stanley he might as well be doing that from abroad. But the key thing Sylvia and Stanley say was the killing of George Floyd and the protests and violence that followed. He remembers that's when he started thinking that he should get a gun to protect his family. When I said that out loud, I was like, you know what? If I have to live in a country where I need a gun to protect my family, then this is not the country for me. At first, Stanley said he put a time limit on the move. So I said, we're going to try this abroad thing for, I said, three months, I'll be back in three months. And that was the deal. Then when I got out there, first week, I said, OK, I'll be back in maybe six months. And then I said, I'm not coming back. Sell it all. When Stanley and Sylvia talk about the difference in the way it feels for an African-American family to be out of America, it sounds as though a tremendous weight was lifted off their shoulders for both them and their children. And I told myself, I can't go back. I can't go back. There have always been Americans who moved to Europe for enjoyment or self-improvement. There were the wealthy sophisticates of the Gilded Age portrayed in novels by Henry James and Edith Wharton, who went to France and Italy to discover culture and never went back. But there are also Americans who left to flee something in America. African-Americans have been doing this for decades. In the 1920s, Josephine Baker. In the 40s through the 60s, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and Nina Simone. I'll tell you what freedom is to me. No fear. I mean, really, no fear. One thing that changes is which countries Americans go to. The statistics show a big rise over the past decade in the number of Americans living in the Netherlands, in Spain, and especially in Portugal. The population of Americans there has tripled to almost 10,000. There are many reasons why Americans are drawn to Portugal. Portugal offers foreigners very attractive tax deals. And a Portuguese government minister I spoke to credited the increase to the fact that Madonna lived in the country for a few years and talked it up. But why Americans end up staying in the country differs from case to case. For the Johnsons, they say the racial atmosphere in their new home is dramatically more relaxed. Things are much more peaceful for us here and we're not regarded with the same level of suspicion or fear that we can experience quite frequently back in the U.S. Sylvia talks about having to unlearn some of the habitual reactions which African Americans develop around racism. One day a police officer approached them while they were parked in their car outside a bank. And based on their American experiences, they were immediately on edge. So we rolled down the window and he said, Oh, do you speak English? Yes. He said, Yeah, I was just looking at your car here. That tire there is really low. As a matter of fact, this one here too, you might need to put some air in the tires and there's a gas station right down the street and he proceeds to tell us how we can get to it. And we both looked at each other afterwards and was like, Wow, that was so bizarre. We're expecting like this police officer to come and cost us for something, you know, some perceived fault. And rather he was trying to look out for us. Escaping racism obviously isn't the only reason Americans move to Europe, particularly those who aren't black. Others move to Europe because health insurance is cheaper or because workers in Europe get longer holidays. In most countries you get at least four weeks and many black and white talk about America as a country that doesn't seem to be able to solve any of its problems anymore. There aren't a lot of Americans moving to Europe. And of course, many more people still want to come to America than to leave it. But America is the ultimate immigrant country. Americans aren't used to thinking of themselves as wanting to leave and go somewhere else. The fact that more of them are, even a few tens of thousands a year, tells you something. I use marker for drawing and I painted it with paint. Good job. I wrote my name with it and the marker. André Piltzikow often had a dream. It was that he was flying an F-16 fighter jet, a fighter Falcon. Anne Rowe is The Economist's obituaries editor. He could go at more than 2000 kilometers an hour, Mach 2. He had a combat range of more than 500 kilometers. The plane was wonderfully agile, could get out of any difficult situation. Sadly though, when he woke up, he was still the pilot of a MiG-29. This was a Russian built plane built in the 1980s. And although it had been upgraded quite a lot since, it was still just not in the same class as the F-16. The worst part of a MiG were the rockets, the R-27s, which were heat seeking. And unless the pilot held them in a permanent lock on their target, they would tend to seek any source of heat on the ground, which might be a school or might be a hospital. So he dreamed of a proper contingent of F-16s with which he could fly around the Ukrainian sky. And he deluged everyone with messages about this, especially the United States, which manufactured the F-16s. They didn't want to give F-16s to Ukraine because of the fear of escalating war with Russia. But Andrei Purchikov was not going to give up there. The other thing that gave him a mystique was his call sign, JUICE. He required this in 2018 when he'd been on joint exercises with the California Air National Guard. He didn't like alcohol and was always ordering juice at parties or when he was in bars. And so the name JUICE stuck. And he was the first member of the Ukrainian Air Force actually to have an official call sign. JUICE was his. He was the natural image of Ukraine's flying heroes. This suited him very well. His favorite film or one of them was Top Gun Maverick. And he had been wanting to be a pilot since he was very small, since he was a child making model airplanes. When he was almost as interested in the instructions and the history of the model that would come out of the box and told you something about the story of the airplane, when it had been used, how it had been involved in battles. So he picked up quite a bit of military history as a child and continued to read it voraciously. It was as a teenager that he began to haunt airfields and eventually managed to fly in an ultralight plane. By 2011, he was in the Ukrainian Air Force. And his first real combat mission was in 2014 when he went to the east to Donetsk and Luhansk where there was already a state of war with Russia. His mission to the east convinced him that he had to be ready at any moment for a Russian invasion. It seemed to him that with a neighbor like that, you had to be ready all the time. And of course, he was someone who was always ready all the time, whether to leap into his cockpit or he was ready to fight the Russians if they dared to invade. When he heard about the invasion, he already had petrol packed for the car. He had his own rifle. He had a pistol. He always flew with his pistol stuffed into his body armor, his survival jacket. He was a man who was determined to be able to fight his way out of any situation. But the best way he knew for Ukraine to fight itself out of its present situation was simply to get these wonderful airplanes, these F-16s. So in June of 2022, he went to Washington in the company of another pilot called Moonfish. And they found there were quite a lot of sympathetic ears in Congress. It took a while for the idea to catch on with the whole of the American government because they were still rather choosy about the use of the F-16s and extremely worried about what Russia would think of their deployment. But in the end, they announced that the Netherlands and Denmark could supply F-16s to Ukraine from their stock. But on the 25th of August, he flew off on a training mission. He was 140 kilometers west of Kiev when the plane he was in and the training craft crashed together and he was killed. He had always known that from any of his flights, he might not come back. You have just a few minutes to get in the cockpit. It's very difficult job because you're permanently ready to go 24-7 at any time in any conditions. What will be the next after that? Where you will land? It's a good question every time. Anne Rowe on Andrei Puleshchikov, who spoke to the intelligence in 2022 and has died aged 30. That's all for this episode of The Intelligence.

       "\"GUEST NAME: Robert Guest\\nGUEST ORGANIZATION: The Economist\\nGUEST TITLE: Deputy Editor\\n\\nSection 1: Racial Tensions in Tunisia\\n- The president of Tunisia, Qais Saeed, falsely claimed that black Africans were plotting to change the nation's demography.\\n- This statement has led to protests and violence against black migrants in Tunisia.\\n- Robert Guest visited the city of Sfax and witnessed the discrimination and violence against black people in the city.\\n- Tunisia was once hopeful because it overthrew a dictatorship and established a democracy, but the current president is reversing democratic reforms.\\n- Fear is being used by leaders to distract attention from their failures and to consolidate power.\\n- This trend of using fear and blaming other groups for a country's problems is becoming more common globally.\\n- Nationalism can be a force for good if there is a genuine external threat, but leaders are increasingly fabricating threats to rally support.\\n- Fear is a powerful tool because it appeals to primal emotions and captures attention.\\n- The fear-mongering tactics of the Tunisian president have resulted in a more fearful, less free, and more corrupt country.\\n\\nSection 2: Americans Moving to Europe\\n- More Americans are expressing a desire to leave the US since Donald Trump's presidency.\\n- The number of Americans living in Europe has increased, with Portugal being particularly popular.\\n- Americans cite reasons such as gun violence, racism, and the inability of the US to solve its problems as motivations for leaving.\\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests have exacerbated the desire to leave.\\n- African Americans have been moving to Europe for decades to escape racism.\\n- For some Americans, moving to Europe offers a more peaceful and less racially tense environment.\\n- Reasons for moving to Europe vary, including cheaper healthcare, longer holidays, and a desire for a change of scenery.\\n\\nSection 3: Ukrainian Fighter Pilot Lobbying for F-16 Jets\\n- Andrei Pilsikov, a Ukrainian fighter pilot, dreamed of flying F-16 fighter jets to defend Ukraine against Russia.\\n- Pilsikov lobbied politicians in the US and Europe to give Ukraine access to F-16s.\\n- His dream was to fly an F-16, which he saw as superior to the MiG-29 he was currently piloting.\\n- Although the US and other countries were initially hesitant to provide F-16s to Ukraine due to fears of escalating the conflict with Russia, they eventually decided to supply them.\\n- Unfortunately, Pilsikov died in a training flight before he could fulfill his dream.\\n\\nSummary:\\nThis podcast episode covers three main topics: racial tensions in Tunisia, Americans moving to Europe, and the story of Ukrainian fighter pilot Andrei Pilsikov. In Tunisia, the president's false claim that black Africans were plotting to change the country's demography has led to protests and violence against black migrants. The episode highlights the trend of leaders using fear and blaming others to distract from their failures and consolidate power. In the context of Americans moving to Europe, reasons cited include gun violence, racism, and a perception that the US cannot solve its problems. The story of Andrei Pilsikov sheds light on his dream of flying F-16 fighter jets to defend Ukraine and his efforts to lobby for their acquisition. Unfortunately, Pilsikov died before realizing his dream. Overall, the episode explores the themes of fear-mongering, migration, and individual aspirations in the face of adversity. The tone of the podcast is informative, highlighting important social and political issues, with moments of seriousness and tension.\""

      "Robert Guest is the Foreign Editor for The Economist and regularly appears on CNN and the BBC. Previously, he covered Africa for seven years, based in London and Johannesburg. Before joining The Economist, he was Tokyo correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, and before that he was a freelance writer based in South Korea.\n",
      "He is the author of The Shackled Continent, a book that tries to explain why Africa is so poor and how it could become less so. Bob Geldof praised the book, saying: \"An excellent book. Timely, provocative and written throughout with a passion for Africa and Africans.\" However, The Shackled Continent and its ideology also came under criticism: \"Here is the authentic voice of the new-style missionary in Africa. Robert Guest is exploring the dark continent with intrepid adventures, carrying not the Bible but the Economist to assure the benighted tribesmen that they can be saved by putting their faith in free-market global capitalism, which will rid them of their local superstitions and bring them a new era of prosperity.\"From July 2009 through May 2010, Robert Guest wrote the opinion column on the United States for The Economist under the pseudonym \"Lexington\". He then returned to London to run The Economist's business coverage.Guest's book Borderless Economics, arguing in favor of freer migration and describing the role that diasporas played in economic development around the world, was published in November 2011.\n"

       "\"The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in demitab format and published digitally. It focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, technology, and culture. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by the Economist Group, with its core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across its social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.\\nFounded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is recognisable by its fire engine red masthead (US: nameplate) and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\\nThe editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism as the concept became established in the late 20th century, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copyediting. Its extensive use of word play, high subscription prices, and depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations. In line with this, it claims to have an influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.\\n\\n\""
